# ChainStat
ChainStat is a decentralized NFT marketplace that tokenizes live IPL 2025 player stats—such as most runs, wickets, or strike rate—as dynamic NFTs. Built on a pool-based system, each stat category generates NFTs that auto-update based on match data every 24 hours. Users can mint, list, and buy these evolving NFTs using the custom ERC-20 YODA token.
